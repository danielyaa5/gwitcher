# gwitcher
A script for switching between github accounts

##Setup
*Notes*: This has only been tested on Mac OS X and will almost surely brake on any other system. Looking for PRs from bash gurus to increase system compatibility.

 
**Requirements**

OpenSSH 7.3 or greater (check version with `ssh -v`, see [here](https://mochtu.de/2015/01/07/updating-openssh-on-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite/) for OS X upgrade instructions)
###Step 1
Download the script and add to path, *i.e.* in Mac OS X
`mv /directory/to/downloaded/script /usr/local/bin`
